      <h1>History</h1>
</center>
  
<p>The birth of McDonald's® began with Raymond Albert Kroc. Ray Kroc was the exclusive distributor of a milk shake maker called the Multimixer. Meanwhile, two brothers, Richard and Maurice McDonald owned and ran a hamburger restaurant in San Bernadino, California, in the 1950s. Ray Kroc heard how well the McDonald brothers were doing using his Multimixers to serve their customers. He met up with them and acquired the franchising right from them to run McDonald's® restaurants.</p>

<p>In 1955, Ray Kroc founded the McDonald's® Corporation and opened the first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois. In 1961, he bought out the McDonald brothers. And the rest, as they say, is history. McDonald's® grew into the largest restaurant organisation in the world. Today, there are more than 33,000 McDonald's® restaurants in 119 countries. <br> Ray Kroc died in 1984 but his legacy is very much alive. His success story continues with McDonald's® families of employees, franchisees and suppliers. His commitment, dedication and achievements continue to live on at McDonald's® restaurants across the world.</p>
